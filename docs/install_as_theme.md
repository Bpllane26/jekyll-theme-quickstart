# Install as theme
> How to install a theme published on RubyGems

_Note: This is theme is not published to RubyGems so these commands will not work. This is here for completeness as a reference. See the approach in [README.md](README.md#installation)_

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-quickstart"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-quickstart
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ bundle install jekyll-theme-quickstart
```
